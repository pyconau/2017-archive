<p><b>11 March: Inaugural Internet of Things mini-conf.</b> The Internet of Things (IoT) mini-conf will be a day devoted to presentations and demonstrations of how Python powers IoT devices, applications and services.
</p><p>
The proliferation of distributed devices connected to the Internet has been an enabler for a variety of new capabilities and services ranging from home automation, to sensor networks, building management systems and smart vehicles. This one-day workshop will concentrate on Python applications and technologies that exploit this global interconnectivity of people, devices, appliances, vehicles, sensors, embedded controllers, and computation.
</p><p>
Python has a diverse ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that makes it a great choice for developing IoT devices, applications and services. The Python ecosystem allows developers to rapidly develop embedded software to interface with and operate remote devices and applications and manage them using tools like Salt and Ansible. Data captured from IoT devices can be analysed using powerful data analytics and artificial intelligence capabilities provided by Numpy, Scipy, and scikit-learn. Captured data can be easily presented on dashboards created using Flask and Django.
</p><p>
The Python community is only just scratching the surface of how Python can power the IoT and this mini-conf will be a great opportunity to discuss and learn about how Python is, and can be, used to develop and deploy IoT devices, applications and services.
</p><p>
- Tomas Krajca and Lachlan Blackhall, IoT mini-conf organisers

<p><b>4 March: Science and Data mini-conf returns.</b> PyCon AU 2016 is excited to announce the third of our special events, the Python Science and Data mini-conference.
</p><p>
The Science and Data mini-conference is a one-day forum for people using Python to tackle commercial and research problems in science, engineering and data science.
</p><p>
Python is a very popular choice for a wide range of scientific disciplines and has a strong set of libraries, frameworks and tools for scientific computing, including the Jupyter notebook, SciPy, pandas and Scikit (to name just a few).
</p><p>
The Science and Data mini-conference is a chance to showcase the use of new and innovative uses for Python in disciplines such as genomics, computer vision, mathematics, high performance numerical computing, fintech, machine learning and data analysis. The mini-conference is also a great opportunity to network with other scientific Python developers and to track some of the emerging trends in scientific Python ecosystem.
</p><p>
We look forward to seeing you at the third PyCon AU Science and Data mini-conference on August 12, 2016.
</p><p>
- Graeme Cross and Clare Sloggett, Science and Data mini-conference organisers

<p><b>24 February: Python in Australian Education seminar returns.</b> PyCon AU 2016 is happy to announce the second of our special events, the Python in Australian Education seminar! This annual, one-day event brings together professional educators across primary, secondary and tertiary levels, as well as Python community workshop organisers, professional Python instructors, and Python developers interested in better engaging with the Australian educational community. This multi-disciplinary approach allows representatives of these groups to share their personal experiences and interests in relation to the use of Python in Australian education, and to identify areas of potential collaboration with each other and with the broader Python community.
</p><p>
Python is a popular "first language" for programmers young and old, especially those making the transition from graphical programming environments like Scratch to text based development. Teaching with Python also offers many opportunities to connect with the wider technology community, as Python is also frequently adopted for real world software development, being cited by IEEE Spectrum magazine as <a href="http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2015-top-ten-programming-languages">one of the top 5 most widely used programming languages in industry</a>.
</p><p>
"The inaugural version of this event in Brisbane provided a wonderful opportunity to help foster greater collaboration between Australian educators and the Australian open source community, so it's exciting to be bringing that opportunity to Melbourne in 2016," said event co-coordinator and Python Software Foundation board member, Nick Coghlan.
</p><p>
Those curious as to just what this seminar is about may want to take a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs4CJRBY5F1I5vuApyUXp6bLWly1E-b0s">the recorded presentations from the 2015 event</a>. More information about the 2016 call for presentations and how to get involved will be circulated as we get closer to the conference. For now, block out your diaries on August 12th (or for the whole conference from August 12th to 16th), start preparing your travel plans and talking to your principal in preparation for this unique event.

          <p><b>11 February: DjangoCon AU returns.</b> PyCon AU 2016 is happy to announce the first of our special events, DjangoCon AU! DjangoCon AU is a special one-day event for the anyone using Django - from beginners just learning how to build their own websites, to experienced engineers looking for tips to optimize their high traffic site.
</p><p>
Django is a fantastic web framework for Python, and has a huge developer base in Australia. “Django users make up a big part of the Python community, and DjangoCon AU has been part of PyCon AU since special event days were introduced 4 years ago. We’re extremely excited to be back again in 2016,” said event coordinator and Django core team member Dr Russell Keith-Magee.
</p><p>
The Django community is also very welcoming to new contributors and users, making it one of the best ways to get started with free software development and making Django a great technology choice. More information about the call for presentations and how to get involved will be circulated as we get closer to the main event. For now, block out your diaries from August 12 to 16th, start preparing your travel plans and buttering up your boss in preparation for this fantastic event.

          <p><b>25 January: Seeking launch sponsors.</b> It's definitely early days still, but we're seeking launch sponsors (those
lucky companies whose name appears on the website from the moment we launch
our CFP) for PyCon Australia 2016, which is being held in Melbourne in
August.
</p><p>
Sponsorship packages are available to suit a range of budgets, from indie
startup to enterprise.Sponsoring PyCon Australia allows companies to boost
their exposure to top tier tech talent and support the local developer
community. All packages include complimentary professional-level tickets so
that your staff can benefit from the conference too!
</p><p>
If you're not in a position to commit to sponsorship, we're also happy to
get early expressions of interest, so that we can contact you again in the
next few months.
