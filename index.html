          <p><b>8 November 2016: Call for Special Events.</b>
We are calling for expressions of interest in running a specialist event:
<ul>
<li>Up to 4 Specialist Day tracks held on Friday 4 August (e.g. DjangoCon AU, Python in Education seminar)</li>
<li>Workshops running in parallel with the sprints (e.g. DjangoGirls, Young Coders)</li>
<li>Associated events run independently, but taking advantage of the presence of a large contingent of Pythonistas in Melbourne (e.g. Software Carpentry workshops)</li>
<li>Icebreaker events for the opening evening or social events during the sprints</li>
</ul>
For more information grab our <a href="special-events-2017.pdf">Call for Special Events document</a>.
            </p>
<!--          <p><b>8 November 2016: Seeking launch sponsors.</b> It's definitely early days still, but we're seeking launch sponsors (those
lucky companies whose name appears on the website from the moment we launch
our CFP) for PyCon Australia 2017, which is being held in Melbourne in
August.
</p><p>
Sponsorship packages are available to suit a range of budgets, from indie
startup to enterprise.Sponsoring PyCon Australia allows companies to boost
their exposure to top tier tech talent and support the local developer
community. All packages include complimentary professional-level tickets so
that your staff can benefit from the conference too!
</p><p>
If you're not in a position to commit to sponsorship, we're also happy to
get early expressions of interest, so that we can contact you again in the
next few months.
            </p>
