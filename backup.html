          <h2>Announcements</h2>
          <p><b>11 February: DjangoCon AU returns.</b> PyCon AU 2016 is happy to announce the first of our special events, DjangoCon AU! DjangoCon AU is a special one-day event for the anyone using Django - from beginners just learning how to build their own websites, to experienced engineers looking for tips to optimize their high traffic site.
</p><p>
Django is a fantastic web framework for Python, and has a huge developer base in Australia. "Django users make up a big part of the Python community, and DjangoCon AU has been part of PyCon AU since special event days were introduced 4 years ago. We're extremely excited to be back again in 2016," said event coordinator and Django core team member Dr Russell Keith-Magee.
</p><p>
The Django community is also very welcoming to new contributors and users, making it one of the best ways to get started with free software development and making Django a great technology choice. More information about the call for presentations and how to get involved will be circulated as we get closer to the main event. For now, block out your diaries from August 12 to 16th, start preparing your travel plans and buttering up your boss in preparation for this fantastic event.

            </p>

          <p><b>25 January: Seeking launch sponsors.</b> It's definitely early days still, but we're seeking launch sponsors (those
lucky companies whose name appears on the website from the moment we launch
our CFP) for PyCon Australia 2016, which is being held in Melbourne in
August.
</p><p>
Sponsorship packages are available to suit a range of budgets, from indie
startup to enterprise. Sponsoring PyCon Australia allows companies to boost
their exposure to top tier tech talent and support the local developer
community. All packages include complimentary professional-level tickets so
that your staff can benefit from the conference too!
</p><p>
If you're not in a position to commit to sponsorship, we're also happy to
get early expressions of interest, so that we can contact you again in the
next few months.
