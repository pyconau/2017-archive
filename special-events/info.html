Friday August 12 to Tuesday August 16. The first day of the conference is the Specialist Day. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>In previous years, special events associated with PyCon Australia have been organised by invitation of the main conference organising committee. This year, an open call will be issued so that any group wishing to organise a special event may apply (including to organisers of special events in previous years). The organising committee will then review and select the events to include in the PyCon Australia 2016 program. Special event organisers will then be brought on as an event organising team, working with the main organising committee and other special event organisers to put together a great community driven event.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Examples of special events that could be included in the program:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_z956smlvj41z-0 start"><li class="c2 c4"><span>Up to 4 specialist tracks (aka &quot;miniconfs&quot;) for Friday&#39;s Specialist Day (e.g. DjangoCon AU, Python in Education seminar)</span></li><li class="c4 c2"><span>Workshops running in parallel with the development sprints (e.g. DjangoGirls, Young Coders)</span></li><li class="c4 c2"><span>Associated events run independently of the conference, but taking advantage of the presence of a large contingent of Pythonistas in Melbourne (e.g. Software Carpentry workshops)</span></li><li class="c4 c2"><span>Icebreaker events for Friday evening</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span>Social events during the sprints</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>These events are all hailed as a major highlight by conference attendees and rely on community members coming forward to help organise them. It&rsquo;s also our chance to help out these groups, as &nbsp;organisers can take advantage of the gathered forces of the Australian Python community without the full burden of organising a national event.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>This is our call to the community: please put up your hand and make yourself known. The 2016 organising committee would like to continue to support these activities while moving towards a more transparent and structured process. This document outlines the process by which special events may be organised.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The following aspects of the event are part of the main conference program and will be handled directly by the conference organising committee:</span></p><ul class="c7 lst-kix_saeqr8mmyte6-0 start"><li class="c0 c2"><span>Weekend talk and tutorial program</span></li><li class="c0 c2"><span>Logistics for Friday&#39;s Specialist Day on-site events</span></li><li class="c0 c2"><span>Call for papers (including for specialist tracks)</span></li><li class="c0 c2"><span>Conference dinner (Saturday)</span></li><li class="c0 c2"><span>Development sprints (Monday/Tuesday, introduction Sunday)</span></li><li class="c0 c2"><span>Financial aid program</span></li></ul><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>We are asking all those interested in </span><span>running </span><span>either a workshop or a full specialist day track to register their interest with the PyCon AU organising committee. It is early in the process so there is a chance to inform the committee around how to best support these events. If you are interested in running a workshop, seminar, miniconf or outreach activity, please let us know. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Note that the Friday specialist tracks are logistically integrated with the main conference (sharing the venue, ticketing, call for papers, etc), but track organisers are responsible for working with the main program committee to craft a compelling talk and tutorial schedule that targets specialist audiences on the Friday, and a more general developer and community audience on the weekend.</span></p><h3 class="c0 c5"><a name="h.4kacklgrt1b4"></a><span>Schedule:</span></h3><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Call for expressions of interest: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 November - 20 December</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Shortlisting of submissions: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 December 2015 - 15th January</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Finalising of shortlisted bids:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30 January 2015</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Special event list finalised: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 February 2015</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">In previous years, some special events have been organised late in the piece.

Then, take the next 4 weeks to develop your expression of interest according to the template below.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Q: What kind of event can I run?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: We are encouraging people to be creative. It is perfectly okay to target a specific audience with a restricted demographics. This could be due to the niche nature of an event (pypy.js) or due to the domain being discussed (education, data science). The event is ticketed separately, so your attendees don&rsquo;t need to pay for the full conference to attend. That said, we would also be looking for some events which will appeal to those looking to extend their two-day conference. Based on the last couple of years attendance, the specialist day attendance is rapidly growing to the same level of significance at the main event, which is a great achievement.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Q: Can I organise my own sponsors if I want to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: This may be an option. You will need to do this in consultation with the PyCon AU organising committee to ensure this is handled effectively. </span><span>Sponsorship opportunities will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the organising committee; if your event will need funding, please make sure that this is noted in your proposal.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Q: How will the </span><span>call for proposals </span><span>be organised this year?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: This is still to be finalised and more information will be shared soon. </span><span>The organising committee are still actively working to deliver an improved and streamlined process that provides greater clarity. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Q: How is this process being managed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: The </span><span>program</span><span>me chair (Tennessee Leeuwenburg) is coordinating the process. This early in proceedings, it is possible that elements of the procedure may change. The new process aims to provide greater clarity, transparency and integrity to the process. We ask those involved to provide their feedback, but also for their understanding that this is a volunteer exercise and that as such we need to rely on a collaborative approach.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Q: How are A/V requirements or other special needs for special events handled?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: The four miniconf-style full-day tracks on the Friday are usually recorded as per any other day of the conference. Events not on-site will need to handle their own AV requirements. If you have other needs for your event, please get in touch to discuss what those might be.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Q: How does room hire work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A (for full-day on-site tracks): We have accounted for four miniconfs being run on Friday, with room hire to be handled by the PyCon AU organising committee. Those selected events will not need to organise their own funding, as that will be handled through the conference ticketing process. Should the organising committee select additional events that would require additional space, funding for those will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: (off-site and additional rooms): Once we have exceeded the on-site room booking we have planned for, there may be additional costs. </span><span>There is a small/medium additional room available on-site at additional cost, otherwise your event will need to run off-site.</span><span>&nbsp;Your event will need to organise to bear those costs, but get in touch with the organising committee to discuss that. Options include additional sponsorship, an additional cost, or anything you can come up with. </span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Q: There is not enough information here! My question isn&rsquo;t answered! Something&rsquo;s wrong!</span></p><p class="c0"><span>A: We understand. At this stage, the focus is on registering your interest rather than on detailed planning and implementation. We will be updating this document as those questions come in and letting everyone know if any changes or a key decision is made. Organising large events is pretty difficult, so be patient and we will sort everything out.</span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0 c3"><span></span></p><h1 class="c0 c5"><a name="h.rwiip56we942"></a><span>Special Event Submission For: &lt;Template Event&gt;</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Event organisers are required to fill out this template to demonstrate adequate financial and logistical planning in order to make the event a success.
